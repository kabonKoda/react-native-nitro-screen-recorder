/**
 * React hook for monitoring and responding to global screen recording events.
 *
 * This hook automatically tracks the state of global screen recordings (recordings
 * that capture the entire device screen, not just your app) and provides callbacks
 * for when recordings start and finish. It also manages the timing of file retrieval
 * to ensure the recording file is fully written before attempting to access it.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Automatically tracks global recording state
 * - Provides lifecycle callbacks for recording start/finish events
 * - Handles timing delays for safe file retrieval
 * - Filters out within-app recordings (only responds to global recordings)
 *
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Show recording indicators in your UI
 * - Automatically upload or process completed recordings
 * - Trigger analytics events for recording usage
 * - Update app state based on recording activity
 *
 * @param props Configuration options for the hook
 * @returns Object containing the current recording state
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 *   const { isRecording } = useGlobalRecording({
 *     onRecordingStarted: () => {
 *       analytics.track('recording_started');
 *     },
 *     onBroadcastModalShown: () => {
 *       console.log("User tried to initiate recording")
 *     },
 *     onBroadcastModalDismissed: () => {
 *       redirectToAnotherApp()
 *     },
 *     onRecordingFinished: async (file) => {
 *       if (file) {
 *         try {
 *           await uploadRecording(file);
 *           showSuccessToast('Recording uploaded successfully!');
 *         } catch (error) {
 *           showErrorToast('Failed to upload recording');
 *         }
 *       }
 *     },
 *   });
